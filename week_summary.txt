This week, Sphurthy addressed dark mode text visibility issues on the Participation page. Sphurthy added CSS variables for dark mode text and borders to the Participation and MyCases stylesheets. Sphurthy updated filter dropdowns in the MyCases, DropOffTracking, and NoShowInsights components to use dark mode text and border tokens, ensuring filter labels, dropdown placeholders, and selected values are readable in dark mode. Sphurthy updated event card header text elements including event names and event times to use dark mode text tokens. Sphurthy updated pill-style category headers, also known as event badges, with dark mode-specific styles using darker background colors, brighter text colors, and borders to ensure visibility against dark card backgrounds. Sphurthy updated count badges displaying attendee numbers to use dark mode text tokens. Sphurthy updated borders throughout the page to use dark mode border color tokens for proper contrast. Sphurthy applied additional dark mode styling to table body cells, insights percentage text, and insights tabs. All filter text, dropdown placeholders, event card headers, and count badges are now visible and readable in dark mode with proper contrast and consistent styling across the page.
