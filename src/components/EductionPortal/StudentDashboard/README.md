# Student Dashboard

A comprehensive student dashboard component for the Education Portal that displays task progress, time logging, and course management.

## Features

### ðŸŽ¯ Core Functionality
- **Dual View Modes**: Card view and List view for task display
- **Real-time Progress Tracking**: Visual progress bars showing completion status
- **Smart Mark as Done Logic**: Different eligibility rules for read-only vs write tasks
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices

### ðŸ“Š Dashboard Components
- **Navigation Bar**: Top navigation with dropdown menus
- **Summary Cards**: Overview of total time logged, weekly progress, and active courses
- **Task Management**: Interactive task cards with status badges and action buttons

### ðŸŽ¨ Visual Design
- **Modern UI**: Clean, minimalist design with subtle shadows and hover effects
- **Status Badges**: Color-coded badges for different task states
- **Progress Indicators**: Animated progress bars with percentage completion
- **Interactive Elements**: Hover states and smooth transitions

## Task Types & Mark as Done Logic

### Read-Only Tasks
- Can be marked as done only after requisite hours are logged
- `logged_hours >= suggested_total_hours`

### Write Tasks
- Automatically marked as done when upload is made
- Can also be manually marked as done if hours requirement is met
- `has_upload = true` OR `logged_hours >= suggested_total_hours`

## Status Badges

| Badge | Color | Condition |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| Comments | Orange | Task has comments but not completed |
| Hours Met | Green | Required hours logged but not marked done |
| Pending Review | Gray | Task in progress, awaiting review |
| Completed | Green | Task marked as completed |

## API Integration

### Current Implementation
- Uses mock data for development and testing
- Simulates API delay for realistic user experience

### Production Setup
To integrate with the actual API, update the following in `StudentDashboard.jsx`:

```javascript
// Replace mock data with actual API call
const response = await axios.get('/api/student/tasks', {
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`
  }
});
```
